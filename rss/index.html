I disliked that setup guide because it was too complicated and resource intensive. The setup that I&apos;ll explain here uses 0% of CPU and 58.3MB of RAM when the server is idle, and up to 0.6% of CPU when it&apos;s working (I have a Intel Core i7-4702MQ CPU @ 2.20GHz). This setup is very lightweight.</p><h1 id="setup-etesync-for-home-usage">Setup etesync for home usage</h1><h2 id="installing-git-and-python3">Installing git and python3</h2><p>To start, you will need to install git and python. The easiest way of doing this is with <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">chocolatey</a>, so <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install">open powershell as administrator</a> and run:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-powershell">Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(&apos;https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1&apos;))
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>After chocolatey has finished installing, close powershell and open it again as administrator. Run:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-powershell">choco install git
choco install python3
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="installing-etesync">Installing etesync</h2><p>We will now setup the etesync server. To do this, open the Command Prompt (cmd) and run these commands:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-batch">cd %appdata%\..\Local

Also, here is where we select what domain we&apos;ll be using. No, you don&apos;t need to register any domains, we&apos;ll do all of this locally. But we must pick a domain name for HTTPS to work.

It completes the destination or origination <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address">network address</a> of a message. Specific port numbers are reserved to identify specific services so that an arriving packet can be easily forwarded to a running application. For this purpose, port numbers lower than 1024 identify the historically most commonly used services and are called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_port_numbers">well-known port numbers</a>.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h1 id="setup">Setup</h1><h2 id="island-or-shelter">Island or Shelter?</h2><p>We must install one of these two apps. <a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/reports/191535/">Island contains Google trackers</a>, but it has a bigger userbase, therefor, less bugs. Meanwhile, Shelter is completely open-source, but has a smaller userbase. For this tutorial I&apos;ll be using Island, since that&apos;s what I&apos;m currently using, but feel free to use Shelter if you prefer so. </p><p>1) Download the app: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.island&amp;amp;gl=US">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.island&amp;amp;gl=US</a></p><p>2) Launch the app and follow the setup instructions given by Island.</p><blockquote>On most middle to high end Android devices released after 2016, Island can be setup straightforward without hassle. But still on some devices, you may got &#x201C;incompatible with your device&#x201D; message on Google Play Store, or be notified during the setup with error message &#x201C;Sorry, your device (or ROM) is incompatible with Island&#x201D;, or other failures. In these cases, Island could probably still work on your device if setup manually.</blockquote><blockquote>If you are prompted to encrypt your device during the setup, it means your device was not pre-encrypted out of box. If you don&#x2019;t want device decription (which may significantly degrade overall I/O performance on some low-end devices), it can be avoided with manual setup.</blockquote><p>You will need a PC and a cable to connect your phone to your PC if you follow <a href="https://island.oasisfeng.com/setup.html">the manual setup guide</a>.</p><p>Side-note: One of Island&apos;s features is that it allows you to &quot;freeze&quot; apps:</p><blockquote><strong>Freeze frequently woken apps.</strong> Clone it into Island and uninstall the original one outside. Then you can freeze it to fully block its background behaviors. Remember to create launch shortcut for quick de-freezing and launching.</blockquote><p>If you enable <a href="https://island.oasisfeng.com/#managed-mainland">the &quot;Managed mainland&quot; feature</a>, you can also freeze apps that are in the main profile. That feature is not needed at all for this setup, but you may find it handy regardless. <a href="https://island.oasisfeng.com/setup.html#activate-managed-mainland">Link to guide</a>. You may also like <a href="https://appops.rikka.app/">AppOps</a>: It allows you to set app permissions to be &quot;ignored&quot;, so that the app will think that it has a permission, but when it tries to use it, it won&apos;t get any data. AppOps also supports the work profile ;)</p><h2 id="netguard">Netguard</h2><p>Netguard is a FOSS app that allows us to control exactly which apps have access to the internet, and which don&apos;t. We can give an app WiFi access, mobile data access, or make it so that netguard doesn&apos;t control the app at all. </p><h3 id="installing-the-app">Installing the app</h3><p>Here, we have two options: Installing from GitHub, or installing from F-Droid. We can&apos;t install netguard from the playstore because <strong>the playstore release doesn&apos;t support port-forwarding</strong>, and that feature is obligatory for us to be able to do our trick.</p><p>I recommend installing NetGuard from F-Droid, since it&apos;s easier to update it from there. If you don&apos;t already have an F-Droid client, I recommend using <a href="https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/auroradroid/-/releases">AuroraDroid</a>. Simply download the APK file, and install it. After opening the app and finishing the setup, search for &quot;NetGuard&quot; and install the first result.</p><p>I recommend spending some time fine-tweaking which apps you give internet access to. Most apps only ask for internet access to show you ads/collect analytics.</p><h2 id="why-personaldnsfilter">Why personalDNSfilter?</h2><p>The Netguard version from github already has hosts blacklists, so why not use just that? Well, Netguard&apos;s host blacklist implementation has a number of <a href="https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md">drawbacks</a>:</p><blockquote>NetGuard ignores the IP addresses in the hosts file, because it does not route blocked domains to localhost.</blockquote><blockquote>Wildcards are not supported due to performance and battery usage reasons.</blockquote><blockquote>It is not possible to edit the hosts file (change/add/delete domain names) with NetGuard</blockquote><p>Also:</p><ul><li>Host blocklists have to be updated manually.</li><li>You can&apos;t view exactly which domains have been blocked.</li><li>You can&apos;t create your own custom DNS resolutions: This is necessary if you&apos;re into self-hosting and you want HTTPS without a public domain.</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/">personalDNSfilter</a> overcomes all of these problems, and so for that reason I strongly recommend it.</p><h2 id="installing-personaldnsfilter">Installing personalDNSfilter</h2><p>This one&apos;s easy. You can either install it from F-Droid (using AuroraDroid), or you can install it from the playstore. They&apos;re both the same.</p><p>After installing the app, tap on &quot;Advanced settings&quot; and make them match this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://itsignacioportal.github.io/content/images/2022/03/pDNSf-config-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot of Advanced settings in personalDNSFilter.

Root mode without local VPN: OFF." loading="lazy" width="323" height="391"></figure><p>What we&apos;re doing here, is configuring pDNSf so it doesn&apos;t use a VPN slot, but instead opens a &quot;DNS proxy&quot; on port 5300. </p><h2 id="installing-the-socks5-proxy">Installing the SOCKS5 proxy</h2><p>Now, you must launch the Google Playstore from within Island:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://itsignacioportal.github.io/content/images/2022/03/island-launching-playstore-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot of Launching the Google Playstore from within the Island app" loading="lazy" width="325" height="703"></figure><p>Now search and install &quot;Every Proxy&quot;. &quot;Every Proxy&quot; has no ads, and no trackers, hence, why I picked it. Make sure NetGuard is up and running on the main profile, and then launch the EveryProxy app, and hit the three dots on the top left corner, then &quot;Settings&quot;. Scroll down to the bottom and make your settings match this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://itsignacioportal.github.io/content/images/2022/03/everyproxy-config-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot of configuration for the SOCKS5 proxy in Every Proxy.

" loading="lazy" width="328" height="544"></figure><p>Of course, you must create a username and password. You don&apos;t really need to remember the password. Just copy it to your clipboard. (IMPORTANT: DO NOT make the password 126 characters long, else netguard will enter a crash loop that might crash your entire phone). Now go back to the main screen of the app, and start the SOCKS5 proxy. Make sure to disable battery optimizations for &quot;Every Proxy&quot;, else Android might kill the app unexpectedly. If you don&apos;t know how to disable these optimizations, go to <a href="dontkillmyapp.com">dontkillmyapp.com</a>. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://itsignacioportal.github.io/content/images/2022/03/everyproxy-socks5-started-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot of Every Proxy with SOCKS5 On." loading="lazy" width="327" height="355"><figcaption>&quot;Every Proxy&quot; with the SOCKS5 proxy activated</figcaption></figure><h2 id="configuring-netguard">Configuring Netguard</h2><p>Now you must go back to your main profile and open Netguard. Do NOT &quot;Deactivate&quot; the work profile.</p><p>Here&apos;s the tricky part. Go into NetGuard -&gt; Three Dots (on the top right corner) -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; Port Forwarding</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://itsignacioportal.github.io/content/images/2022/03/netguard-port-forwarding-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="327" height="260"></figure><p>Once you&apos;re inside that menu, click the &quot;<strong>+</strong>&quot; icon on the top right corner. Make the details match the following screenshot:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://itsignacioportal.github.io/content/images/2022/03/netguard-port-forwarding_detail-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot of netguard configuration. Protocol: TCP. Destination address: 127.0.0.1. Destination port: 5300. Destination app: personalDNSFilter." loading="lazy" width="292" height="459"></figure><p>Click OK. Now do the exact same thing again, but instead of selecting &quot;TCP&quot;, select &quot;UDP&quot;.</p><p>Basically, what we&apos;re doing is configuring netguard so whenever an outbound DNS request goes through port 53, it will be redirected to localhost (127.0.0.1) to port 5300 to personalDNSFilter. We use port 5300 because that&apos;s the only port that pDNSf can work on without having root, without occupying the VPN slot.</p><p>Now go back to the main screen of the app. Look for &quot;personalDNSFilter&quot; and untick the &quot;Apply rules and conditions&quot; checkbox:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://itsignacioportal.github.io/content/images/2022/03/netguard-pdnsf-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="screenshot of personalDNSfilter being excluded from control by netguard." loading="lazy" width="326" height="191"></figure><p>We do this so that there isn&apos;t an infinite DNS loopback: For example, if Google Chrome wants to resolve example.com, then the request will go through NetGuard, which will use 127.0.0.1 as the DNS resolver. pDNSf will resolve it according to its configuration, but when it makes the outbound dns resolution request to it&apos;s configured DNS servers, that request will be caught by NetGuard, which will try to resolve it using 127.0.0.1, so pDNSf requests tries to resolve it, but its caught by NetGuard, who tries to resolve it using 127.0.0.1, so pDNSf requests tries to resolve it, and so on and so forth....</p><p>Now we have to configure netguard to use the SOCKS5 proxy. Go to NetGuard -&gt; Three Dots (on the top right corner) -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced Options and scroll down to the section about the SOCKS5 Proxies:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://itsignacioportal.github.io/content/images/2022/03/netguard-socks5-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Netguard config screenshot.

Socks5 password: redacted." loading="lazy" width="330" height="263"></figure><p>The &quot;SOCKS5 username&quot; and the &quot;SOCKS5 password&quot; must match the username and password that you configured on &quot;Every Proxy&quot;.</p><p>Lastly, we have to configure the <em>VPN DNS</em>. Go to &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Advanced Options&quot; and scroll down. Set both &quot;VPN DNS&quot; settings to<strong> any WAN external server </strong>(Avoid &quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, &quot;10.1.10.1&quot;, &quot;192.168.0.1&quot;, and such. Copy me if you&apos;re not sure on what server to use). It doesn&apos;t matter what servers you pick here, your DNS requests won&apos;t be sent to these servers. The DNS requests will be redirected to pDNSf thanks to the forwarding rule we setup earlier.</p><p>Why not just put &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; as the VPN DNS you ask? To put it simply, NetGuard has DNS Leaks which can only be avoided using this hacky method. Without this workaround, who our ISP is would be exposed, and nobody wants that!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://itsignacioportal.github.io/content/images/2022/03/netguard_VPN-DNS.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="325" height="184"></figure><p> If you want more information about how this whole setup works, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/FDzrffF">click here</a>.</p><h2 id="installing-the-actual-vpn">Installing the actual VPN</h2><p>Finally! Just like you installed &quot;Every Proxy&quot; on the work profile, now do the same but instead look for the VPN that you want. In my case, I&apos;ll be using ProtonVPN.</p><p>After starting the VPN, if you did everything right, you should see some traffic starting to pop up on your VPN app:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://itsignacioportal.github.io/content/images/2022/03/protonvpn-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Screenshot of ProtonVPN with traffic coming through." loading="lazy" width="294" height="574"></figure><p>You can verify that the VPN is working by going to any of the following sites with the VPN activated:</p><ul><li><a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com">whatismyipaddress.com</a></li><li><a href="https://browserleaks.org/dns">browserleaks.org/dns</a></li><li><a href="https://whoer.net">whoer.net</a></li></ul><p>Just make sure that your browser is controlled by NetGuard, else it will just bypass the entire system.</p><p>If you wish to <strong>disconnect </strong>from the VPN without dropping any packets, do this, in this specific order:</p><ul><li>Disable &quot;Use SOCKS5 proxy&quot; in NetGuard.</li><li>Stop your VPN app and the SOCKS5 proxy on &quot;Every Proxy&quot; (the order of these two steps doesn&apos;t matter, hence why they&apos;re combined in a single bullet point).</li><li>&quot;Deactivate&quot; the work profile using the notification from Island.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
